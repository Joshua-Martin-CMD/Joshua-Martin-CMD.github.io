If you are starting your CDK path see these great resources
- [CDK Bootstrapping](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/bootstrapping.html)
- [CDK API Refrence](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/python/index.html)
- [CDK Context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/context.html)
  
Explained well on the What is the AWS CDK([source](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html))

That the CDK allows us to extend what we already have with Cloudformation ([source](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/))
Now we are able to extend that capablity with Languages such as Python, Go, Typescript, Java and More with Constructs.
Also giving the end DevOps or Software Developer a Relible, Scalable and Cost effective application with AWS.

snippet from the CDK Guide linked in 'explained well'
    Build with high-level constructs that automatically provide sensible, secure defaults for your AWS resources, defining more infrastructure with less code.
    Use programming idioms like parameters, conditionals, loops, composition, and inheritance to model your system design from building blocks provided by AWS and others.
    Put your infrastructure, application code, and configuration all in one place, ensuring that at every milestone you have a complete, cloud-deployable system.
    Employ software engineering practices such as code reviews, unit tests, and source control to make your infrastructure more robust.
    Connect your AWS resources together (even across stacks) and grant permissions using simple, intent-oriented APIs.
    Import existing AWS CloudFormation templates to give your resources a CDK API.
    Use the power of AWS CloudFormation to perform infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly, with rollback on error.
    Easily share infrastructure design patterns among teams within your organization or even with the public.
